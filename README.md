# DataStructure
This .NET project focus on implementations of data structure & algorithms. <br />
It doesn't provide any front-end interface. <br />

<h3>Graph Folder</h3>
Implement graph using adjacency list representation: Each Node object has a list of adj. nodes.  <br />
Algorithms include Breath first search (BFS) & Depth first search (DFS). <br />
MSTest is used for testing the algorithms (BFS & DFS).
