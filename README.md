This .NET project aims to implement the most typical data structure & algorithms. <br />
This project has not yet completed.  <br />

<h3>Graph Folder</h3>
Implement graph using adjacency list representation: Each Node object has a list of adj. nodes.  <br />
Algorithms include Breath first search (BFS) & Depth first search (DFS). <br />
MSTest is used for testing the algorithms (BFS & DFS).

<h3>BinarySearchTree Folder</h3>
Implement BST & related algorithms
